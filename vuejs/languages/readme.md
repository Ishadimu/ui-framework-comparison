# Languages

**Most Common:** ES5 or ES6+

## ES5

ES5 is fully supported. Vue.js can be used without using any _new_ or _future_ JavaScript language features.

## ES6

ES6 is fully supported. Vue.js can be used with all _new_ and _future_ JavaScript language features, often alongside a transpilation library.

## TypeScript

Vue.js 2.5.0+ ships with improved type declarations which brings out of the box support for typescript.

## Flow

Flow can be used alongside Vue.js for static type checking and is widely adopted by the community and development team. Much of the source of Vue.js leverages flow for type safety. 

## JSX

The Vue.js team maintains an official [babel plugin](https://github.com/vuejs/babel-plugin-transform-vue-jsx) that brings JSX support to Vue.js. Using the babel plugin, you are able to write JSX render functions for your Vue.js components.
