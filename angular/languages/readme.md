# Languages

**Most Common:** TypeScript

## ES5

ES5 is fully supported. Angular can be used without using any _new_ or _future_ JavaScript language features.

## ES6

ES6 is fully supported. With that being said, the community typically recommends switching to TypeScript if you've moved beyond ES5.

## TypeScript

Angular is TypeScript focused and is the recommended language for development. Most docs and examples online are and will continue to be written in TypeScript.

## Flow

Using flow with angular is not a common practice. If type safety is desired, the community typically recommends TypeScript.

## JSX

There is no *official* support for JSX in angular. There is a few community libraries that attempt to bring support to angular but they are not widely used or maintained.
