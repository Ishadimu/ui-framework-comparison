# ui-framework-comparison

The goal of *ui-framework-comparison* is to provide an objective, criteria-based evaluation of today's most popular JavaScript UI frameworks and libraries. This project is not intended to make a recommendation, but instead to provide you, your team or your organization with the research and demos necessary to come to an informed conclusion. There is no *"one size fits all"* answer in todays front-end environment, but more often than not any of the candidates can be setup to suit your needs.
