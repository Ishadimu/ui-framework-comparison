# Components

Evaluate what component and companion libraries are available and actively maintained. Identify any gaps in component availability and explore the effort necessary to implement.

### Considerations:

- Do the identified libraries have official support or are they community built? 
- What does *state management* look like? 
- What does *routing* look like? 
- What does *data management (model/store)* look like? 
- Are there charting library wrappers available? For which libraries? 
- What table or grid libraries are available? Do they scale infinitely?
