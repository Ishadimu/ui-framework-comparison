# Incremental Adoptability

Evaluate the incremental adoptability of the framework or library to determine the feasibility of running it alongside existing SPAs. Explore the pain points and recommended approach for integrating into an existing application.

### Considerations:

- What is the support for code-splitting and modular loading of the application? 
- Can the framework be used inside of or alongside an existing SPA? What are the implications? 
- How does an incremental adoption impact CI / CD decisions?
