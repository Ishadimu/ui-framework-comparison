# Languages

**Most Common:** ES6+ & JSX

## ES5

ES5 is fully supported. React can be used without using any _new_ or _future_ JavaScript language features. The documentation has examples for ES5 syntax.

## ES6

ES6 is fully supported. React can be used with all _new_ and _future_ JavaScript language features, often alongside a transpilation library. The documentation has examples for ES6 syntax.

## TypeScript

React does not provide official type definitions for React, but the [community definitions](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@types/react) are widely used and actively maintained. Additionally, Microsoft has an official [TypeScript-React-Starter](https://github.com/Microsoft/TypeScript-React-Starter) project.

## Flow

Being a Facebook library like React, Flow is widely used both by the React development team and the community that builds with React.

## JSX

JSX was written for and released with React and will be used by most projects using React. While [not explicitly required](https://reactjs.org/docs/react-without-jsx.html), JSX provides significant productivity boosts and improves code clarity when working with React.
